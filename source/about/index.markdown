I build products on the web, mostly with Rails and JavaScript.  I've helped
bring startups from idea to validation to revenue, working as a consulant at
Boston web firm [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/).  I agree with much of what
is written in the [thoughtbot playbook](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/) on the
philosophy of building businesses on the web.

With thoughtbot, I've also designed and delivered
[Ruby and Rails training workshops](http://workshops.thoughtbot.com/), and
helped write and market an e-book on using
[Backbone.js and Rails](http://workshops.thoughtbot.com/backbone-js-on-rails).

I attended the [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://www.rit.edu/), where I
studied computer science, organized what is now the
[Rochester Ruby](http://www.meetup.com/rochesterrb/) user group, and met my
wonderful wife Lindsay.

In November 2011, we are leaving our home in Boston, MA and moving to New Delhi,
India.  It's the first step in an open-ended, plan-it-as-we-go adventure in
long-term travel and living abroad.
