I build products on the web, mostly with Rails and JavaScript.

My wife Lindsay and I [traveled for a year in 2012](/2012/12/31/a-year-of-travel/).

I've helped bring startups from idea to validation to revenue, working as a
consulant at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/).  I also designed and
delivered [Ruby and Rails training workshops](http://learn.thoughtbot.com/),
and helped write and market an e-book on using [Backbone.js and
Rails](https://learn.thoughtbot.com/products/1-backbone-js-on-rails).

I attended the [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://www.rit.edu/), where I
studied computer science, organized what is now the
[Rochester Ruby](http://www.meetup.com/rochesterrb/) user group, and met my
wonderful wife Lindsay.
