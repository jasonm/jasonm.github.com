Monday, Jan 5 2009: Tonight is the first night of <a href="http://www.nublabs.org/">nublabs</a>' <a href="http://nublabs.com/mailman/listinfo/kitmakers_nublabs.com">Kitmakers course</a>.  I'm excited to see how it goes!

I'm primarily interested in building equipment for do-it-yourself biology, such as <a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/DIYbio:Notebook/Open_Gel_Box_2.0">an inexpensive, high quality gel electrophoresis apparatus</a>.

-- cut to Thursday, Jan 8 --

...and today was the second night.  There were notably fewer people tonight, but it rocked anyhow.  I learned how to use the Bridgeport mill to do basic manual milling and how to use the digital readout, turned some aluminum in a lathe, and watched an intro to MIG welding.

Then, with <a href="http://nublabs.org">Alex</a>'s help, I put together a variable DC power supply with a variac, bridge rectifier (three of them, actually - but only because we blew two), and a resistor+capacitor to smooth the resulting voltage.  Photos:

Next week I'd like to test the power output on an oscilloscope, and start working on building a "draft" of an enclosure.
