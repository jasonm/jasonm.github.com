In a whirlwind two weekends, I've given a <a href="http://diybio.org">DIYbio</a> talk with Kay Aull and Mac Cowell at <a href="http://codecon.org">CodeCon 2009</a> and will be at the <a href="http://cambridgesciencefestival.org/">Cambridge Science Festival</a> (<a href="http://diybio.org/2009/04/21/diybio-boston-at-cambridge-science-festival-this-saturday/">details</a>), <a href="http://www.barcampboston.org">BarCamp Boston 4</a>, and <a href="http://www.themakerrevolution.com/">The Maker Revolution</a> (Sunday at 1:00pm).

CodeCon was a fantastic experience - San Francisco was enjoyable as always, and it was stimulating to be around so many incredibly bright folks.  Thanks again to Len, Bram, and all the organizers for putting it together and for hosting the BioHack! track.

I hope to record the talk material with Kay and Mac, titled "DIY Synthetic Biology: From Design to Construction with New Model Organisms," so that it is available online in the near future.
