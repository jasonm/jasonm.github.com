<p>In my last term at <span class="caps">RIT</span>, I took a course titled Innovation and Invention with Dr. Jon Schull.  It was rather experimental, with a breakneck pace and minimal organization that was both highly productive and rewarding.  It has continued to flourish, and has significant overlap with the new <a href="http://casci-web.rit.edu/~collaboratorium/">Collaboratorium at <span class="caps">RIT</span></a>.</p>


	<p>As part of this course, I worked on a multitouch display (see my <a href="http://touch.tumblr.com">project log for the multitouch table</a>).  <a href="http://www.synchala.net/">Matthew Kampschmidt</a> and I gave a talk that introduces multitouch technology and applications, as well as the fundamentals behind <span class="caps">FTIR</span> (<a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/~jhan/ftirtouch/">Frustrated Total Internal Reflection</a>).</p>
