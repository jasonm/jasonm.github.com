On November 28, my wife Lindsay and I are flying to New Delhi, India.  We have
no return tickets, and little plan.  Why?

I'm leaving a [great company](http://thoughtbot.com) that's doing excellent and
interesting work.  "Professional ennui" is as close to wrong as you could get
when describing my perspective here.  Why am I leaving?

If there's one common lesson I could distill from my exposure to
the internet, college professors and peers, and professional engagements, it
would be the value of diverse experience.

I grew up in small towns with relatively homogenous culture.  Frankly, a
thirteen-year-old me underestimated the value of our first dialup connection.


The internet and going to college taught me about the breadth of
ideas in the world.  I regret not finding them earlier in my local library, but

Cut down my unknown
unknowns.  The hard thing about perspective is you can't neatly plan to build
it.  You have to throw yourself into uncertain situations.

Is this a story, or is it persuasive writing?  It's not persuasive, it's a
story.

Who is my audience?
* Technical and business, but friendly.

What is my goal?
* To help organize my own thoughts about why I am traveling
* To open and contextualize the story of my travel because I want to write more about it
* To encourage others who are interested to reach out
