<p style="text-align: left;">A little while back, I resigned from my position at <a href="http://www.vistaprint.com">VistaPrint</a> to take a great opportunity at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot, inc</a> in downtown Boston.  I'll be starting with them on Monday, June 9, and am super excited to join their small and dynamic team.  Initially, I'll be working on <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects">tools for the Nature Publishing Group</a> like <a href="http://network.nature.com">Nature Network</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I got to hang out with some of the team at <a href="http://www.railsconf.com">RailsConf</a>, see some top-secret <a href="http://teebot.thoughtbot.com/">Tee-Bot</a> designs, go on some exciting Portland excursions and adventures, and I might have even learned a little Ruby or Rails along the way.</p>
