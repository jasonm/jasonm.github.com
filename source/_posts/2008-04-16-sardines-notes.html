<h3>Notes</h3>
Authentication (I am who I say I am) can happen via OpenID.  Authorization (what may I do?) shall happen through the central document server.  One idea: public server allows login for all OpenIDs who have registered through it.  Upon publishing, you must confirm the publish /on/ the public server, while you are authenticated to the pubserv as the same OpenID who initiated the publish (visibility promotion) action

Time spent: 12/27: 15m organizing tidying svn repo, bugfix
