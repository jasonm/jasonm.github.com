On Friday, October 14th, I hosted a two hour live Q&A chat for purchasers of the thoughtbot [Backbone.js on Rails eBook](http://workshops.thoughtbot.com/backbone-js-on-rails), which I am co-authoring. We invited people who have purchased the book to submit questions ahead of time, and then join me in chat for a discussion.

I'm pleased that we are offering the recording and notes as a free resources. You can [download the Backbone.js on Rails live Q&A chat audio and notes](http://workshops.thoughtbot.com/pages/backbone-js-on-rails-qa-live-chat-1) over on the thoughtbot Workshops site.
