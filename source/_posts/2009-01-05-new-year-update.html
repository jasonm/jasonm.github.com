Hey folks!  It's been a while (whew... 6 months?) since my last update here.  Here are a few things I've been up to, and what my plans over the next few months are:
<ol>
	<li>Built and delivered <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">awesome web applications with thoughtbot</a>, and will help to roll out a <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/training">beginning Rails thoughtbot training course</a> later this January.</li>
	<li>Attended RailsConf, RubyConf, the Lone Star Ruby Conference, and spoke at Boston.rb on <a href="http://github.com/jasonm/talks/tree/master">Clearance, a small auth plugin for Ruby web apps</a>.</li>
	<li>Started learning more biology in earnest by taking a <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k38681">cell- and micro-bio course at Harvard Extension</a> and working with <a href="http://diybio.org/">DIYbio</a>.  While the lecture is a very good one, as lectures go, I preferred the lab to the lecture and, as such, intend to do more hands-on learning in 2009.  A few projects I would like to undertake include:
<ol>
	<li>Working through <a href="http://www.biotechinstitute.org/resources/shoestring_biotech.html">Shoestring Biotechnology: Budget-Oriented High Quality Biotechnology Laboratories for Two-Year College and High School</a>.</li>
	<li>Working on at least one piece of equipment with DIYbio folks, such as <a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/DIYbio:Notebook/Open_Gel_Box_2.0">Open Gel Box 2.0</a>.</li>
	<li>Participating in a DIYbio iGEM team.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
If you are interested in keeping tabs on what I'm up to, I'd suggest either my <a href="http://twitter.com/jayunit">twitter feed</a> or the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/diybio">DIYbio Google Group</a>, as these are my highest-touch interactions these days.
