If you're going to RailsConf this week, let's grab some drinks and catch up!

I'm looking forward to hanging out with <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">my awesome coworkers</a>, my Ruby friends from all around, and giving a lightning talk on <a href="http://bioweathermap.org">the BioWeatherMap Initiative</a> at the <a href="http://activeresearch.org">ActiveResearch</a> "Science on Rails" evening (<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/9023">Tuesday at 7:30pm</a>).

<strong>Update: </strong>I've uploaded my talk from ActiveResearch to SlideShare:Â  "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmorrison/bioweathermap-at-active-research">BioWeatherMap at ActiveResearch</a>."
