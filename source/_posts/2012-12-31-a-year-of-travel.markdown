On December 4, Lindsay and I returned to the US after a year of [traveling
abroad](/2011/11/11/hitting-the-road/).  Lindsay diligently blogged our
experiences and her photos at [cadeparade.com](http://cadeparade.com).

We have spent December visiting family and friends.  On December 31, we
fly to San Francisco to start the next chapter of our lives.

## It's adventure time all over again

Time to sift through apartments and carefully consider our work, to reacquaint
ourselves with first world amenities and first world problems.  To reunite with
family and friends, to fondly shuffle through our notes and photos, and to
reflect on our travel experiences and put them into context.

Also, to eat fajitas and burritos en masse, because let me tell you: Mexican
and Tex-Mex food outside the Americas just is not the same.

## The first half in photos

half of the year._

During the first six months of December 2011 through May 2012, we traveled in
India, Thailand, Laos, Vietname, Cambodia, and Burma (Myanmar).

We traveled to places beautiful and remote:

Ate incredible foods:

And some not-so-incredible ones:

We enjoyed amazing sunsets:

We ventured across deserts:

We marvelled at constructions old and new:

During the second six months of June through November, we traveled in the Czech
Republic, Italy, Turkey, Germany, France, England, Thailand (again! we are
quite fond of it), South Korea, Malaysia, and Hong Kong.  We ended the trip
where we began, returning to India for a month.

I cannot recommend this experience highly enough.  My sense of perspective and
patience have been changed at a fundamental level.  At the same time, I'm very
much ready for this return to the US, to be with friends and to focus on my
career, to do good in this world of which I've now seen a tiny slice more.
