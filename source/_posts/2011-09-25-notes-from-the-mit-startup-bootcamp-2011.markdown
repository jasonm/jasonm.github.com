Yesterday, September 24 2011, I had the pleasure of attending MIT's 2011
[Startup Bootcamp](http://startupbootcamp.mit.edu/). In its third year, Startup
Bootcamp brought an inspiring and thoughful collection of speakers who have had
a variety of kinds of startup success.

The event hashtag [#sb2011](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23sb2011) is a stream
of reactions and pull-quotes from the event - mixed here and there with
excited anticipation for
[a dance fesetival in Goa](http://twitter.com/SunburnFestival).

Ten speakers presented a variety of viewpoints, insight, and food for thought.

It was a mixed bag - yes, there was unnecessary focus on
[vanity metrics](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/12/why-vanity-metrics-are-dangerous.html)
and the rah-rah of
[startup theater](http://justinvincent.com/page/1392/entreporn-the-fallacy-that-wastes-your-life).
Breathless celebration of hockeysticking uniques and of flying around to court
VCs makes for good TechCrunch articles.  Like it or not, that's an inculcated
part of startup culture.

But if you get past the Hollywooding and the Silicon Valley adulation, there
were gems of solid advice, grounded in experience, on hiring (Paul English of
kayak), data-driven product development (Naveen Selvadurai of foursquare),
optimizing your life for personal growth (Drew Houston of Dropbox), identifying
underlying social and technological shifts that enable new products (Charlie
Cheever of Quora, Patrick Collison of Stripe), negotiation (Alex Polvi of
Cloudkick), the importance of on-the-ground and unscalable product development
tactics early on (Nathan Blecharczyk of Airbnb), earning and answering to the
responsibility of finding your own way in the world (Anthony Volodkin of
hypemachine) and how impossible it is to overstate the importance of empowering
yourself in perhaps the largest disruptive theme of our century, software, by
learning to code (Patrick Collison of Stripe).

### [Paul English](http://paulenglish.com/), CTO and co-founder of [Kayak](http://www.kayak.com/team).

> Recruit a diversity of success.

Spoke on recruiting 3 kinds of recruiting: companies recruiting new hires,
companies recruiting investors, and job-seekers recruiting companies.

He has three operating priorities: team first, customers second, and profit
third.

When you're recruiting, look for success, regardless of the kind.  In fact, look
for a diversity of success. Paul once hired an olympic rower. and a chess
grandmaster, and couldn't be happier with these decisions.  Find people who
operate at the top levels of excellence.

Some companies have a "no assholes" rule - at Kayak, they have a policy of "no
neutrals".  Like [later speaker], who discussed the importance of hiring people
you have high-bandwidth communication with, Paul encouraged building a team of
people who are intense and in-your-face in a good way.

### [Leah Culver](http://blog.leahculver.com/about.html), CEO and co-founder of [Convore](https://convore.com/)

> Show up, say yes.

Leah told an entertaining story of her journey from a big state school CS
program to a Silicon Valley startup founder.  Full of serendipity and luck, she
shared stories of driving a UHaul from her native Minnesota out to the Bay Area
to flee the weather, getting started with Instructables, and bumping into Pownce
co-founders Kevin Rose and Daniel Burka at a party.

"Have a good story to tell the press - you don't have to tell people the ugly,
dirty truth."

Another of Leah's pieces of advice was a common thread through the talks -
consistent applied effort.  "Show up," she said -- in places with a critical
mass of startup people, such as Silicon Valley -- and "say yes" to opporunities
that come your way.

### [Andrew Sutherland](http://asuth.com), founder of [Quizlet](http://quizlet.com/)

> I didn't just rush it on my parents that I was leaving MIT. It took two whole weeks.

Andrew shared his story of inspiration for an online learning tool.  When he
hacked together a prototype to help study for a French III class in high school
and subsequently aced the test, he knew he was onto something.

Andrew discouraged market research - "If I had googled for online flash cards, I
would have found other sites, that were not as good, and I wouldn't have made
Quizlet.  Now, we're 10x the [volume] of our next competitor."  

The audience reaction on Twitter
[found this contentious](http://twitter.com/#!/BobbieC/status/117616203874316288).
I would frame his advice as: focus on your own products rather than on the
competition, and don't be discouraged by incumbent players; rather, recognize
them as a validation of the market space, and proceed to out-execute them.

### [Naveen Selvadurai](http://naveenium.com/) co-founder of [foursquare](http://foursquare.com)

> At first, go with your hunch.  Later, with data.

Naveen worked for Lucent and Sun in college.  This was important - it's
real-world learning.  Seeing engineering culture, doing code reviews, shipping
real products.  Sun had an open culture of learning where you can dive into
other products.  "How'd they build Solaris?  File systems?"  Just sign up for
the mailing list.

Naveen shared seven pieces of distilled advice:

1. Keep good company.
2. Make something that people want.
3. Build around an atomic action.
4. Seek mentors early.
5. At first, go with your hunch.  Later, with data.
6. Balance unknowns with knowns.
7. Always be recruiting.

On the last point Naveen shared the four stages of foursquare's hiring strategy:

1. Friends
2. Friends of friends
3. External agency (got burned)
4. Internal fulltime recruiter

### [Charlie Cheever](http://twitter.com/#!/ccheever), founder of [Quora](http://www.quora.com/)

> Work with people you have really high-bandwidth communication with.
> Understand how the other person is thinking.

Charlie shared great advice on early-stage tactics.  Start with few users (Quora
started with fewer than fifty) and a low-cost MVP.  Foster the community by hand
- be high-touch and, if your business builds on user-generated content, be
  prepared at the beginning to build a lot of it by yourself.  See how the
experiment goes, and then take the learning from that experience and apply it to
your MVP.

He shared the importance of collecting metrics early on - with Quora,
they took the approach of actually storing the entire webpage for every visit
for every customer, so that they could go back later, having identified trends
or formulated hypotheses, and see the site as their users saw it.  They noticed
a set of high-engagement users, looked at these users' expereinces, and found
that they had all used Facebook connect.  This drove the team to focus on this
social element.

Charlie also left the audience with good food for though: What wave enables your
product?  Why is now the right time to build it?  For foursquare, it was
GPS-enabled mobile phones.  For Quora, it was that "normal" people were
comfortable sharing things online, and that the web was turning into a mess;
with Google turning up more content farm results, people were moving onto safe
harbors of organized information like IMDB and Wikipedia.

And, in closing:

> Stand for something.


### [Drew Houston](http://twitter.com/#!/drewhouston), co-founder of [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com)

> Get out of your comfort zone.  Learn a little about a lot.

"Everything big starts small" - Drew's original perception of startups was that
of Tolkein's Mount Doom.  He originally thought the best way to build a
successful startup was to be overwhelmingly prepared - nab an MIT CS degree, get
a few years' exerpience working for small companies and big companies alike,
come back for a PhD, maybe an MBA.

Then he shared Dropbox's origins: he had just settled into his seat on Chinatown
bus from Boston.  He popped open his laptop, and searched his pockets for his
ever-present USB thumb drive.  "Shit."  Realization set in just as he
visualized, in his mind's eye, the thumb drive sitting on his desk at home.
"Like any good engineer with a problem to solve, I opened my editor."  Drew
then wrote the first lines of what would eventually become Dropbox.  Today, his
company has a multi-billion dollar valuation and "stores more files than Twitter
stores tweets."

He exhorted the audience to learn about a broad variety of topics: sales,
marketing, finance, accounting, product design, psychology, influence,
negotiation, organizational design, management and leadership, business
strategy.  Buy books, dip in, find mentors, and surround yourself with smart
people.

Wrapping up, Drew shared his advice for success:

* Take on more than you're "ready for."
* The fastest way to learn about startups is to join one, not lengthy preparation.
* Maximize how much you learn per unit time.
* Stack the odds in your favor. Surround yourself with great people; you are the
  average of your five closest friends.
* Starting a company is one of the best ways for engingeers to change the world.

### [Alex Polvi](http://alex.polvi.net/), founder of [Cloudkick](https://www.cloudkick.com/)

> No matter what number they offer, pause, count to 10 in your head, and then act as disappointed as possible.

Alex spoke on negotiation, and specifically about his experience of his company
Cloudkick being acquired by Rackspace.

* If a VP of Corp Dev says "strategic" to you, they are talking about
  acquisition.
* Acquisitions are a bit like romantic relationships: you often get the most
  attention when you're least looking for it.  Once you are involved with one
  party, others can sense it, and you somehow become more desirable.
* Once you have a term sheet from one prospective buyer, you have great
  leverage.  When others call you up, you can very quickly get to hard numbers.

> The best negotiation position is one of truth.  Build something of value that
> people want, and your position is irrefutable.

Alex also discussed the importance of taking care of your team, and the people
around you.  Upon acquisition, he fully accelerated all employees' options -
whether they had been with Cloudkick for four years or four weeks, they were all
fully vested and could share in the company's success.  It was important that
the acquiring party, Rackspace was on board with this - and they were.
Rackspace wanted the new team members to stick around not because they were
waiting to vest, but because they wanted to be there.

### [Anthony Volodkin](http://fascinated.fm/), founder of [Hype Machine](http://hypem.com)

> Venture Capital?  You do not need anyone's permission to make stuff.

Regarding investment: Anthony shared the perspective that VC or angel investment
can be very important, but it's not for everyone.  "I don't want to shut
something off because the math doesn't work.  For people to not remember it.
That would be sad."

Anthony's vision was a question: while people with cool friends can get
interesting music recommendations from that network, what about people without
cool friends?  He knew that there was great taste and insight being shared by
music bloggers online, and sought to aggregate and distill it.  "I didn't want
to miss anything."

(If music startups are your thing, Anthony couldn't recommend highly enough
[Dalton Caldwell's talk from Startup School 3 on music
startups](http://www.slideshare.net/daltoncaldwell/startupschool3).)

> Find your own way.

He didn't take investor money, and started Hype Machine from his dorm room.
This gave Anthony and his team the freedom to run the company as they pleased.

"We wanted to travel," he said - so they packed their bags and hung out in
Berlin for a month.  It was cheaper than they would have thought, "about six
thousand dollars," and incredibly fun.  But if they'd had VC money?  "No way,"
Anthony imagined an advisor's response, "we thought you were, you know, going to
be working sixteen hour days.  Now you want to go to Berlin and _maybe work_?"

> YCombinator?  TechStars?  Just fucking make something.

Anthony's philosophy is this: it's okay to have a different process.  With a
different process, it's easier to stand out, to be differentiated.  You can
always get money if you are making something great.

### [Nathan Blecharczyk](https://twitter.com/#!/nathanblec) of [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com)

> You have to have a vision, you have to be able to execute that vision.

Nathan shared a 2008 pitch deck for AirBnb (then AirBed&amp;Breakfast) - the
first time this deck had ever seen the light of day.
Tiffany Kosolcharoen posted [photos of the slides on her blog](http://tiffanyk.com/post/10611384492/honored-nathanblec-shared-original-airbnb).

He highlighted its strengths - it had a problem statement, and had a bottom-up
business projection by analogy to CouchSurfing and Craigslist.  He was also
quick to point out its weaknesses - it involved hand-wavy mentions of unlikely
major player partnerships, and touted top down projections ("If we can capture
2% of the $1.9B travel booking market... imagine!") that are quick to raise
doubt from savvy adviors or investors

The company was accepted in Y Combinator's Winter 2009 class.  YC companies are
supposed to be heads-down; but, at Paul Graham's behest, the cofounders zeroed
in their market focus to NYC and hopped redeyes back and forth every few weeks.
They met with their initial supply-side renders in bars, and chatted about how
things were going.  As the team refined the product and identified sticking
points, they were on the ground helping to optimize listings.  They'd go with
people into their homes and take high-quality photos for the site.  They found
that the initial asking rates were a little too high, so they asked their
listers (after a few drinks) to lower their prices.  Things clicked, and soon
they had handled $250,000 in bookings of which they collected 10%.

Fast-forward to the YC W09 Demo Day, and although at that point AirBnb has
already accepted Sequoia investment, they had prepared a Demo Day deck.  Gone
was the hand-wavy top-down projection and partnership hopefulness, replaced with
a quarter million dollars of demonstrable traction, a tight initial market
focus, and a tight, clear problem statement.

### [Patrick Collison](http://collison.ie/) co-founder of [Stripe](http://stripe.com)

> It is impossible to motivate great people by something that is merely going to be profitable.

Patrick's talk was an excellent finish to the day.  He delivered an essay full of engaging stories  - I sincerely hope it will be posted online in full.

Patrick's story was of his trip from hardcore Lisp academic to startup founder.  Along the way, he developed one of the first iPhone apps, an [offline Wikipedia](http://collison.ie/wikipedia-iphone/index-new), before the SDK and App Store, by debugging ARM assmebly. He shared the touching experience of getting emails form users whose lives he had changed; from bringing the world's knowledge to villages in rural Peru and Ghana to delivering the freedom to browse Wikipedia without overisght to people behind the Great Firewall of China.  At nineteen, he co-founded and sold an online action tool, and is currently working on a new payment startup, Stripe.

> The anthropological story of the last twenty years is that software is taking over the world. Even if you're a traveling violinist, you should learn how to program.  Do all you can to ensure code is not a foreign language.
