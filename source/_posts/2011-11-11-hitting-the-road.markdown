On November 28, my wife Lindsay and I are flying to India.  We have
no return tickets, and little plan.  I'm leaving a [great job](http://thoughtbot.com);
"professional ennui" is the furthest thing from my motivations.  What's going on?!

## It's adventure time!

If there's one common lesson I could distill from my collegiate and
professional engagements, it would be the value of diverse experience, and the
difficulty of _planning_ to build that experience.  Sometimes you just gotta
jump in learning's way.

We're young, not tied down, and have seen like 0.0001% of the world.  So,
earlier this year, after getting engaged, we decided: let's hit the road!  Our
plans are loose.  As of now, we:

* Have 1-way tickets to Delhi and 5-year visas to India.  Many countries in
  Asia have VOA (visa on arrival) for US citizens.
* Got our arms jabbed (immunizations).
* Are brandishing a fat sack of doxy and a veritable menagerie of antibiotics.
* Booked two days booked at a hotel to buffer our jetlag.
* Asked a friend-of-a-friend to find a short-term lease in Delhi.
* Are super frigging pumped.  I mean, come on!

I'll miss the crap out of my friends here in the US.  We're flying around a bit
to visit folks before heading overseas - San Fran tomorrow through Wednesday,
then Buffalo, then Houston for Thanksgiving.

Then, on November 28, IAH-ORD-DEL.
