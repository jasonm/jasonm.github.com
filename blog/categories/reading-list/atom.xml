    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am maintaining a reading list:</p>

<p><a href="http://jayunit.net/reading-list">http://jayunit.net/reading-list</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m choosing a theme per month, with several works on the theme.
I&rsquo;ll try to collect notes at the end of each month about what I read and wrote,
what I thought, and how I might revisit that theme in the future.</p>

<p>Take &ldquo;reading&rdquo; loosely &ndash; presentations and podcasts definitely count.</p>

<h1>What did I complete in February?</h1>

<p>My high level goals for February were to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read about <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>,
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_Reactive_Programming">FRP</a>,
and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>.</li>
<li>Do some toy projects with these.</li>
<li>Skim a finance book.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Meteor</h2>

<h3>What did I read?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Read the <a href="http://book.discovermeteor.com">Discover Meteor</a> book.</li>
<li>Watched the <a href="http://2012.realtimeconf.com/video/matt-debergalis">RealtimeConf 2012 talk</a>.</li>
<li>Listened to the <a href="http://javascriptjabber.com/076-jsj-meteor-js-with-marcus-phillips-and-fred-zirdung/">JavascriptJabber podcast episode on Meteor</a>.</li>
<li>Understood more about Deps from the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/fitc_slideshare/meteor-reactivestyle">Programming in the Reactive Style with Meteor JS slides</a>.</li>
<li>Went to a <a href="https://www.meteor.com/blog/2014/02/14/pete-hunt-talks-facebook-react">Meteor Devshop talk</a>
about <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and <a href="https://github.com/benjamn/react-meteor">react-meteor</a>.</li>
<li>Built a <a href="https://github.com/jasonm/toy-meteor-chat">toy chat app in Meteor</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Thoughts:</h3>

<p>Lots of interesting ideas, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll use Meteor.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll use
parts (DDP).</p>

<ul>
<li>Isomorphic (same code for the client and server) is interesting.  I would have to
build a large app to see demonstrated advantages, but can imagine.</li>
<li>Seems to work best when all used together, but no reason you couldn&rsquo;t
extract e.g. DDP or Deps and use in an existing application.  (Right?)</li>
<li>There are three places to get packages &ndash;
<a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#usingpackages">core</a>,
<a href="https://atmosphere.meteor.com/">Atmosphere</a>, and,
<a href="http://meteorhacks.com/complete-npm-integration-for-meteor.html">as of June 2013, NPM</a>.
It&rsquo;s nice that they bless a small set of core packages as a stdlib of sorts,
although I don&rsquo;t understand the need for Atmosphere and NPM to be separate.</li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#deps">Deps</a> module, especially <code>Deps.autorun</code>,
is a particularly elegant approach to automatic dependency registration that
avoids the need for static analysis.  The clever part relies
JavaScript&rsquo;s single-threaded nature, and tracks the current computation
as <code>Deps.currentComputation</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>At first I thought this could break down if you depend on a boolean
expression <code>a() &amp;&amp; b()</code>.  If <code>a()</code> returns <code>false</code>, the language
short-circuits evaluation so that <code>b()</code> is never invoked, so the
dependency is not registered.  However, once <code>a()</code> returns <code>true</code>, <code>b()</code>
will get run and the dependency is registered correctly.  There must
be some shortcomings?  External data is a clear example, but that is
covered by the more explicit <code>Deps.Dependency</code> facilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Questions:</h3>

<ul>
<li>What effect does DDP and the use of a document storage model inform data
modeling?  How would you build a system like DDP atop a relational model?
One system I work on uses multiple steps of data mapping (SQL &ndash;> Python
objects &ndash;> JSON &ndash;> Backbone models and back).  This seems like unnecessary
layers of complexity, and replicating a datastore into the client, like
minimongo does, seems like a preferable situation in many cases.  How
might you introduce DDP to an existing rich-client application without
rewriting it in Meteor?</li>
<li>How do you build for reliability atop DDP and RPC?  (E.g. ensuring all
RPC endpoints are idempotent.)  How does DDP navigate timeout/retry/backoff?
See <a href="http://awwx.ws">Andrew Wilcox</a>&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/awwx/meteor-offline-data">meteor-offline-data</a> work.</li>
<li><p>How does operational transform (OT) fit in?
Compare to the <a href="https://github.com/codeparty/derby">Derby</a> framework and
its <a href="https://github.com/codeparty/racer">Racer</a> library, which uses
<a href="http://sharejs.org/">ShareJS</a> for OT:</p>

<ul>
<li>OT is one approach to conflict resolution.  I assume there are many.  What
are the tradeoffs?</li>
<li><p>What other conflict resolution approaches exist?  Maybe some in
the <a href="http://thinkdistributed.io/blog/2013/08/28/causality.html">thinkdistributed.io Causality episode</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The correctness problems of OT led to introduction of transformationless post-OT schemes, such as WOOT, Logoot and Causal Trees (CT). &ldquo;Post-OT&rdquo; schemes decompose the document into atomic operations, but they workaround the need to transform operations by employing a combination of unique symbol identifiers, vector timestamps and/or tombstones.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation</a></p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>If you use OT, can you use tree-structured data?
Is the scope of OT limited to a document?  Can you coordinate operations across
documents?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>What would I study about this next?</h3>

<ul>
<li>How does the very new (documented February 27)
<a href="https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Using-Blaze">Blaze rendering system</a>
compare to React?</li>
<li>How well does Meteor play with other libraries?  I recall seeing a
&ldquo;modularized&rdquo; version of Meteor where some parts were available a la carte.
What does it look like to involve something like Backbone for models?  React
for DOM computation?</li>
<li>What is the multi-server story (for performance and for availability)?  I
think that the <a href="https://www.meteor.com/blog/2014/02/24/meteor-071-oplog-support-for-complex-queries-meteor-developer-accounts">new oplog work</a>
is supposed to support this.</li>
<li><a href="https://trello.com/c/Gf6YxFp2/42-sql-support">SQL bindings</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)</h2>

<h3>What did I read?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Read <a href="http://conal.net/fran/tutorial.htm">Composing Reactive Animations</a> as
an introduction to the concepts.</li>
<li>Read <a href="http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/icfp97.pdf">Functional Reactive Animation</a>

<ul>
<li>Read somewhat thoroughly.  General ideas of facts / behaviors over
implementation is nice.  I learned about the idea of using integration
to determine a value at a point in time rather than continual
time-chunked evaluation, refreshed some of my Haskell notation,
and thought about the general idea of declaring behaviors and letting
the implementation handle optimizations and discretization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Skimmed <a href="http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/push-pull-frp.pdf">Push-Pull Functional Reactive Programming</a>

<ul>
<li>I started this, but got bogged down in notation and FP/Haskell concepts.  I
should revisit this after reviewing Monads/Monoids/Applicatives in
March, probably from learnyouahaskell.com.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Listened to the <a href="http://javascriptjabber.com/061-jsj-functional-reactive-programming-with-juha-paananen-and-joe-fiorini/">JavascriptJabber podcast episode on Functional Reactive Programming</a></li>
</ul>


<p>There are a bunch more resources <a href="https://github.com/jasonm/reading-list/wiki/2014-February">in my 2014-February reading-list page</a>
that I collected but didn&rsquo;t get to.</p>

<h3>Thoughts:</h3>

<p>Seems like a solid theoretical underpinning for complex dataflow apps.</p>

<p>FRP concepts (behaviors) have similarities to promises &ndash; they represent an
abstraction of a value.  Promises represent a future value.  Behaviors
represent a value which may vary continuously over time, they are functions of
time.</p>

<p>From reading the papers, I also learned a more general concept &ndash; that of a
paper separately introducing formal semantics from a specific implementation.
I haven&rsquo;t read enough CS papers to know how typical this is.</p>

<p>That reminds me of a <a href="http://thinkdistributed.io">thinkdistributed.io</a>
podcast on Raft (a consensus algorithm) which was designed for
understandability, seemingly a novel goal in CS research.  The result is a
large number of (attempted) implementations, because the theory was so
approachable.  Does the Raft paper propose a formal semantics?  See in
May/June.</p>

<h3>Questions:</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to try out <a href="https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js">https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js</a> and read about
underlying ideas.</p>

<h3>If I were to study further/return to this, what would I look at?</h3>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get to read too much about FRP.  I would like to try some of
the JS implementations to build some small dataflow applications.
I&rsquo;d like to build some medium-sized React.js apps and compare that
experience to the FRP libraries.</p>

<h1>React.js</h1>

<h3>What did I read?</h3>

<p>First, I read about React from other people:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read many of <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/">David Nolen&rsquo;s articles about Om and React</a> (seriously just go read David&rsquo;s entire blog, it&rsquo;s the inspiration for so much of my reading this year)</li>
<li>Grasped a key idea in React with <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/react-another-level-of-indirection">Eric Normand&rsquo;s &ldquo;React: Another Level of Indirection&rdquo;</a></li>
<li>Finally got the big picture from <a href="http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/pete-hunt-react-rethinking-best-practices.html">Pete Hunt&rsquo;s &ldquo;React: Rethinking Best Practices&rdquo;</a> talk</li>
<li>Read about React&rsquo;s <a href="http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2013/diff/">fast tree-diff algorithm</a> which underpins its virtual DOM implementation</li>
<li>Read a (biased? :) comparison by Pete Hunt of <a href="http://skulbuny.com/2013/10/31/react-vs-angular/">React vs Angular</a></li>
<li>Read about <a href="http://joelburget.com/backbone-to-react/">Khan Academy engineers' experience of adopting React</a></li>
<li>Listened to <a href="http://javascriptjabber.com/073-jsj-react-with-pete-hunt-and-jordan-walke/">the JavascriptJabber podcasts episode on React</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Then I react the docs themselves:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html">React tutorial</a></li>
<li>Read the <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html">React guides</a></li>
</ul>


<p>And aimed to get my hands dirty:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reviewed my friend <a href="http://brandontilley.com/2014/02/24/creating-chrome-extensions-with-react.html">Brandon Tilley&rsquo;s article on Creating Chrome Extensions with React</a></li>
<li>Went to a <a href="https://www.meteor.com/blog/2014/02/14/pete-hunt-talks-facebook-react">Meteor Devshop talk</a>
about <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and <a href="https://github.com/benjamn/react-meteor">react-meteor</a>.</li>
<li>Wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jasonm/toy-viewport-splitter">negligible amount of code</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Thoughts:</h3>

<p>Looks good, I want to do more with it.</p>

<p>The design of React is very appealing; using functional composition, cohering
templates with view logic, implementing synthetic DOM events atop delegation,
and providing an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff684178">immediate mode atop the DOM&rsquo;s retained mode</a>
Not sure on the JSX syntax, but I think I&rsquo;ll like it as soon as I install
<a href="https://github.com/mxw/vim-jsx">vim-jsx</a>.</p>

<h3>If I were to study further/return to this, what would I look at?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Build something more substantial with React</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a>, a CLJS wrapper atop React enjoying
advantages from immutable data structures and presumably other CLJS
fanciness</li>
<li>What does <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/clojure/XQ4wuUc0bCk/vpCxosZvbyMJ">this discussion</a> mean by &ldquo;UI as value&rdquo;?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finance</h2>

<p>On my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/100ideas">Mac Cowell</a>&rsquo;s recommendation, I
skimmed some of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Still-Market-Books-Profits/dp/0470624159">The Little Blue Book That Still Beats the Market</a>.
I maintain a healthy level of skepticism, but underneath the &ldquo;wow it&rsquo;s pure
magic!&rdquo; skin appears to be a proxy for value investing that identifies
underpriced companies.  Time will tell if broad dissemination of this
valuation strategy will correct the underpricing, or if it holds.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to, as an exercise, build a software implementation of this strategy
and backtest it.  I&rsquo;d also like to understand if there is affordable
historical market information that avoids
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship bias</a>, and to understand what
other <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/363901-the-perils-of-backtesting-technical-strategies">backtesting blind spots</a>
I may have.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll follow this up (also on Mac&rsquo;s recommendation) with Graham and Zweig&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing/dp/0060555661">The Intelligent Investor</a>,
maybe in March or April.</p>

<h1>Retrospective</h1>

<p>The pace for this month was quite high, but I enjoyed keeping up with it.
I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to schedule reading nights on my calendar to try
and block some time off for paying attention.</p>

<p>I could not read some of the FRP papers for lack of understanding of
some foundational functional programming concepts (applicatives, monoids),
so I will read on those next month.</p>

<p>I wish I had done more hands-on programming with these new tools.</p>

<p>The part I have enjoyed the most is discussing these ideas with others.
I&rsquo;d like to try small reading groups or journal clubs around some of my
future readings.</p>

<p>Next, onto <a href="https://github.com/jasonm/reading-list/wiki/2014-March">March reading: including Clojure, FP concepts, and core.async</a>.</p>
